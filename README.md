Google Reader Starred
=====================

Allows to view starred items from Google Reader.

There are many different services that will take your feeds and will allow you to view them, but there is
no such simple thing for starred items.  If you're like me, you have a lot of starred items, and reading
them in json format is not fun.

Instructions
============

1. Go to https://www.google.com/takeout/
1. Create Archive for Reader
1. Download zip file and unzip it somewhere
1. Load [index.html](index.html)
1. Select the starred.json file from the file you unzipped
